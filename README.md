Stuff I use on my MacBook. This is my first time using macOS so trying to gather any useful stuff.

## Software

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) - Package manager for installing apps from terminal
- [aText](https://www.trankynam.com/atext/) - Text automation (Not as good as [AHK](https://www.autohotkey.com/) but good enought for simple text snippets, like `;ra` → `→`)
    - Also check `aText/` dir in this repo
- [AltTab](https://www.autohotkey.com/) - Bring back legendary Alt + Tab from Windowsß
	- If you want it to work like in Windows, do this: Preferences → Appearance → Hide apps with no open windows: ✓
	- You can change to look of it quite a bit if you don't like the default look
- [LinearMouse](https://linearmouse.org/) - Disable mouse scrolling acceleration, fix forward/backwards buttons for external mouses
- [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) - Improve your terminal experience
	- Also check [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) and [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) plugins
- [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/) to get your windows in order
	- [Reactangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) free alternative, but doesn't support custom layouts
- [Shottr](https://shottr.cc/) - Superb screenshot tool

## Settings

- [Hide desktop icons](https://www.howtogeek.com/730231/how-to-hide-all-desktop-icons-on-mac/)
- [Mapping Ctrl-hjkl to arrow keys on macOS](https://rarelyneeded.com/2019/11/20/mapping-ctrl-hjkl-to-arrow-keys-on-macos/)
	- Check `.hammerspoon/init.lua` in this repo
	- This script unfortunately doesn't work with space or caps lock :/
- [Hide/show dock faster](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/34097/450173)
