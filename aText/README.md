# aText scripts

Download aText with `brew install atext`. Contains pretty much same stuff as [mtsknn's special_characters.ahk](https://github.com/mtsknn/AutoHotkey/tree/master/scripts/special_characters) script, there might be some of my own additions/changes.

## Additions

- `;tick` → `✓`

## Changes

- `h'` → `g'` (ä)
- `h;` → `g;` (ö)
